## **What is CIRA Secure IoT Registry?

![IOT Registry Logo](/images/IoT%20Registry%20logo.png)

The CIRA Secure IoT Registry enables Zero Touch registration, activation and transfer of eSIM based IoT Devices. It leverages the eSIM as the hardware Root of Trust in an IoT device and is based on the IoT SAFE standard from [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-safe/). Check out our Labs page for mere details on [this project.](https://cira.ca/iot) 


## **L Spark Medtech Accelerator
CIRA Labs has partnered with Telus, Solace and Blackberry to provide a technology platform the for medical device innovators in the [TELUS L-SPARK Medtech Accelerator](https://www.l-spark.com/accelerator/secureiot/). We are using a dev kit that has a Thales eSIM, Quectel BG96 Modem and a Raspberry Pi 4. The middleware code is here based on a [golang wrapper](https://github.com/CIRALabs/iot-safe-middleware)

## **Telus and Thales POC
We have developed a functional POC by partnering with Telus and Thales. We built upon the [Thales middleware code](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/iot-safe-middleware)
A Dev Kit containing a Thales eSIM, Cinterion Modem and Raspberry Pi 3 was used for this POC.

## **Secure IoT Accelerator Program
We participated in the LSpark Secure IoT Accelerator accelerator and developed our ParkOServe [Demo](https://github.com/TELUS-Emerging-IoT/Secure-IoT-Accelerator). We used aDev Kit that had a G&D eSIM, Quectel BG96 Modem and a Raspberry Pi 3.
