# CIRA-5G-IoT-Registry
CIRA's 5G IoT Registry Project Information

The CIRA Labs team recently joined L-SPARK Global’s Secure IoT Accelerator program (https://www.l-spark.com/accelerator/secureiot/) to help solve a massive, industry-wide problem: securing 5G internet of things (IoT) devices.

Over the coming year, CIRA Labs will be working with a cross-disciplinary team of experts, technologists and advisors to develop a cutting edge Secure IoT Registry – an innovative framework to securely provision 5G IoT devices.

CIRA is presenting the 5G IoT Registry prototype at the GSMA MWC19 Los Angeles congress (https://www.mwclosangeles.com/).  This repo includes CIRA Labs' Powerpoint demonstration slides and prototype screenshots.
