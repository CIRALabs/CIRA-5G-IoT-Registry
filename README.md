# CIRA-Secure-IoT-Registry Project

CIRA Secure IoT Registry enables Zero Touch registration, activation and transfer of eSIM based IoT Devices. We are leveraging the eSIM as the hardware Root of Trust in an IoT devicthe based on the IoT SAFE standard from GSMA (https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-safe/). This repo includes CIRA Labs' Powerpoint demonstration slides and prototype screenshots.

We have developed a functional POC using a Dev Kit that contains
* a Thales eSIM
* Cinterion Modem
* Raspberry Pi 3

The CIRA Labs team is currently participating in the TELUS L-SPARK Medtech Accelerator (https://www.l-spark.com/accelerator/secureiot/) to provide a technology platform for medical device innovators. 

CIRA has presented the Secure IoT Registry in Oct. at ICANN 69 (https://meetings.icann.org/en/remote69).  

And of course we have a cool sticker :-)
