## **What is CIRA Secure IoT Registry?

![IOT Registry Logo](/images/IoT%20Registry%20logo.png)

The CIRA Secure IoT Registry enables Zero Touch Device Identity Management of IoT devices. It leverages the eSIM as the hardware Root of Trust in an IoT device and is based on the IoT SAFE standard from [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-safe/). Check out our Labs page for more details on [this project.](https://cira.ca/iot). Connect with us if you are interested in knowing more about this project or partnering with us.  


## **L Spark Medtech Accelerator
CIRA Labs has partnered with Telus, Solace and Blackberry to provide a technology platform the for medical device innovators in the [TELUS L-SPARK Medtech Accelerator](https://www.l-spark.com/accelerator/secureiot/). We are using a dev kit that has a Raspberry Pi 4, Thales eSIM, Quectel and Telus BG96 Modem. The middleware code is here based on a [golang wrapper](https://github.com/CIRALabs/iot-safe-middleware)

## **Telus and Thales POC
We have developed a functional POC by partnering with Telus and Thales, more info. in the [Case Study] (https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/mobile/secure-elements/gsma-iot-safe-specifications). 
We built upon the [Thales middleware code](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/iot-safe-middleware)
A Dev Kit containing a Raspberry Pi 3, Thales eSIM, Cinterion and Telus BG96 Modem was used for this POC.

## **Secure IoT Accelerator Program  
We participated in the LSpark Secure IoT Accelerator accelerator and developed our ParkOServe [Demo](https://github.com/TELUS-Emerging-IoT/Secure-IoT-Accelerator). We used aDev Kit that had a Raspberry Pi 3, G&D eSIM, Quectel and Telus BG96 Modem.
